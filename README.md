# Freecodecamp Dublin
Repository create to help and shared code to members of FCCD(freecodecamp Dublin).

This our first repository on github. 
For the next couple weeks we had these goals.
Build a simple page (Html, Css, Js, Bootstrap) FDDC (Free Code Camp Dublin)
Our second goal is build our personal profile simple page.
Well, he plans to set up regular meetings every month, so if you had some trouble or need a help? Post on the Facebook group.
This is our first step.
This document will be improved soon we complete our first goal.
If the group wants a study group at weekends just set and organize each other ok?
